Less fine in appearance than many other ferns, it nonetheless makes a dramatic statement in a woodland garden or under deciduous trees. Once established, it will even grow in dry shade.

Its lacy fronds are initially quite green, but as they mature, they often develop a silvery grey colouring, with a contrasting burgundy-red flush to the stems and midribs. It makes a beautiful addition to a woodland or jungle-themed setting where it can be teamed with other shade-loving perennials including hostas and bergenias.",

Forming on a slowly spreading rhizome and topping slender stems, they create a rather lacy, ethereal effect. Often retaining some (if not all) of its fronds throughout the winter in milder regions, its happiest in a sheltered spot, but in colder regions, it can be grown in a pot and moved to an unheated greenhouse or conservatory when the temperatures start to drop.",
